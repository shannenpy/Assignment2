# Assignment2

(driving centre booking system)
This project is to build a website to provide driving lessons and practice for anyone who wishes to get a license. Users can come and search for any license type they wish to get and pay for the course to begin their learning. Once paid, users will have access to **free video lessons**, as well as **free practice quizzes**. Users can book lesson slots, learn remotely and read about the different licenses all in one website.

## Design Process

### User Stories

- As the owners of the driving school, we wish to create a hassle free platform for our current and potential students to get their desired driving licenses.

- As someone who is interested in getting their license, I want to see what they offer so that I can compare with other schools.

- As an existing user, I want to get as much practice as I can so that I can pass my test on the first try instead of spending more money to retake it.
