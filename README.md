# Driving Centre:car::school:

This project is to build a website to provide driving lessons and practice for anyone who wishes to get a license. Users can come and search for any license type they wish to get and pay for the course to begin their learning. Once paid, users will have access to _free video lessons_, as well as _free practice quizzes_. Users can book lesson slots, learn remotely and read about the different licenses all in one website.
